                This bat can be best called as a<br> 
                female fatale, because of her<br> 
                seductive nature and shrewd<br>
                personality. A skilled thief who<br>
                loves stealing jewels and precious<br>
                items for her own selfish<br>
                desires, she also has a heart of<br> 
                gold. Do not mistake her for her<br> 
                so-called negative aspects; she teams<br>
                up with her friends to destroy and<br>
                defeat Dr. Eggman's creations.
