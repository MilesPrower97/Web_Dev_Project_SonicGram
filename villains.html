                This robot was created prior to Metal Sonic,
                so more or else it can be called as its
                predecessor. Mecha Sonic had appeared
                in very few games but its skills were very
                similar to Metal Sonic. As the name suggests,
                it was created to match the abilities of Sonic
                the Hedgehog, in addition to flight and
                spike projectiles. However, Mecha Sonic
                didn't last for long because Sonic had
                eventually destroyed it for good.

                This character calls itself as the
                robotic replica of Sonic the Hedgehog.
                Ever since Mecha Sonic's destruction,
                Dr. Eggman wanted to build an even
                more powerful robot than Sonic
                himself. And that has turned true
                to a certain point. With abilities
                like super sonic speed and mid-air,
                Metal Sonic has been an even bigger
                nuissance than Eggman himself. However,
                loss is the only word that eventually
                comes down for this robot, when Sonic
                & his friends team up to defeat it.

                The root cause for all that is bad.
                Dr. Eggman, formerly known as
                Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is the
                only other human character, apart
                from Dr. Eggman Nega, who has the
                higest levels of intelligence.
                As a result, he can build anything
                that you can imagine; from spaceships to
                large aircrafts to powerful robots etc.
                He is the arch nemesis of all the
                characters from Sonic's world. He
                is also very ambitious, as he intends
                to create his own dream world, Eggman Land.
                Despite all this, he is easily defeated
                by Sonic and his friends.

                Dr. Eggman Nega is a descendant of Dr. Eggman,
                who time travelled to the past to take over
                Blaze's world. His ideas are very similar to
                that of Eggman, but is far more cruel than him.
                He initially hated Eggman because the latter
                was unable to take over the world despite his
                so called ideas and inventions. Eventually he
                teamed up with Eggman to take over Sonic's and
                Blaze's world but failed miserably. He does not
                even think twice before acting.

                Egg Robos are a class of robots that
                are considered as the robotic replicas
                of Dr. Eggman. They briefly appeared
                in Sonic 3 and Knuckles as the boss
                for Knuckles during the latter's
                gameplay. After being destroyed by
                Sonic and his team, Egg Robos have not
                made any canonical appearances since then.
                However, they have played a significant
                role in aiding Dr. Eggman when he invaded
                Angel Island to steal the Master Emerald.
