                This robot was created prior to Metal Sonic, <br>
                so more or else it can be called as its<br>
                predecessor. Mecha Sonic had appeared <br>
                in very few games but its skills were very <br>
                similar to Metal Sonic. As the name suggests,<br>
                it was created to match the abilities of Sonic <br>
                the Hedgehog, in addition to flight and <br>
                spike projectiles. However, Mecha Sonic <br>
                didn't last for long because Sonic had <br>
                eventually destroyed it for good.

                This character calls itself as the <br>
                robotic replica of Sonic the Hedgehog. <br>
                Ever since Mecha Sonic's destruction, <br>
                Dr. Eggman wanted to build an even <br>
                more powerful robot than Sonic <br>
                himself. And that has turned true <br>
                to a certain point. With abilities <br>
                like super sonic speed and mid-air,<br>
                Metal Sonic has been an even bigger <br>
                nuissance than Eggman himself. However, <br>
                loss is the only word that eventually <br>
                comes down for this robot, when Sonic <br>
                and his friends team up to defeat it.

                The root cause for all that is bad. <br>
                Dr. Eggman, formerly known as <br>
                Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is the <br>
                only other human character, apart <br>
                from Dr. Eggman Nega, who has the <br>
                higest levels of intelligence. <br>
                As a result, he can build anything <br>
                that you can imagine; from spaceships to <br>
                large aircrafts to powerful robots etc. <br>
                He is the arch nemesis of all the <br>
                characters from Sonic's world. He <br>
                is also very ambitious, as he intends <br>
                to create his own dream world, Eggman Land.<br>
                Despite all this, he is easily defeated <br>
                by Sonic and his friends.

                Dr. Eggman Nega is a descendant of Dr. Eggman, <br>
                who time travelled to the past to take over <br>
                Blaze's world. His ideas are very similar to <br>
                that of Eggman, but is far more cruel than him.<br>
                He initially hated Eggman because the latter <br>
                was unable to take over the world despite his <br>
                so called ideas and inventions. Eventually he <br>
                teamed up with Eggman to take over Sonic's and<br>
                Blaze's world but failed miserably. He does not <br>
                even think twice before acting.

                are considered as the robotic replicas <br>
                of Dr. Eggman. They briefly appeared <br>

                Sonic and his team, Egg Robos have not <br>
                made any canonical appearances since then.<br>

                Angel Island to steal the Master Emerald. <br>
