                  <p>This robot was created prior to Metal Sonic,
                    so more or else it can be called as its
                    predecessor. Mecha Sonic had appeared
                    in very few games but its skills were very
                    similar to Metal Sonic. As the name suggests,
                    it was created to match the abilities of Sonic
                    the Hedgehog, in addition to flight and
                    spike projectiles. However, Mecha Sonic
                    didn't last for long because Sonic had
                    eventually destroyed it for good.</p>

                  <p> This character calls itself as the
                    robotic replica of Sonic the Hedgehog.
                    Ever since Mecha Sonic's destruction,
                    Dr. Eggman wanted to build an even
                    more powerful robot than Sonic
                    himself. And that has turned true
                    to a certain point. With abilities
                    like super sonic speed and mid-air,
                    Metal Sonic has been an even bigger
                    nuissance than Eggman himself. However,
                    loss is the only word that eventually
                    comes down for this robot, when Sonic
                    & his friends team up to defeat it.</p>

                  <h5>Dr. Ivo Robotnik 'Eggman'</h5>
                  <p>The root cause for all that is bad.
                    Dr. Eggman, formerly known as
                    Dr. Ivo Robotnik, is the
                    only other human character, apart
                    from Dr. Eggman Nega, who has the
                    higest levels of intelligence.
                    As a result, he can build anything
                    that you can imagine; from spaceships to
                    large aircrafts to powerful robots etc.
                    He is the arch nemesis of all the
                    characters from Sonic's world. He
                    is also very ambitious, as he intends
                    to create his own dream world, Eggman Land.
                    Despite all this, he is easily defeated
                    by Sonic and his friends.</p>

                  <p> Dr. Eggman Nega is a descendant of Dr. Eggman,
                    who time travelled to the past to take over
                    Blaze's world. His ideas are very similar to
                    that of Eggman, but is far more cruel than him.
                    He initially hated Eggman because the latter
                    was unable to take over the world despite his
                    so called ideas and inventions. Eventually he
                    teamed up with Eggman to take over Sonic's and
                    Blaze's world but failed miserably. He does not
                    even think twice before acting.</p>

                  <p>Egg Robos are a class of robots that
                    are considered as the robotic replicas
                    of Dr. Eggman. They briefly appeared
                    in Sonic 3 and Knuckles as the boss
                    for Knuckles during the latter's
                    gameplay. After being destroyed by
                    Sonic and his team, Egg Robos have not
                    made any canonical appearances since then.
                    However, they have played a significant
                    role in aiding Dr. Eggman when he invaded
                    Angel Island to steal the Master Emerald.</p>
